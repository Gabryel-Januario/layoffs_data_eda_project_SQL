# 📊 SQL EDA – Layoffs Dataset

This repository contains a full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL, based on a global layoffs dataset stored in the `world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2` table.

## 🔍 Objective

The goal of this project is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to mass layoffs across companies, industries, and countries over time using only SQL.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

- Clean and well-commented SQL queries
- Use of `GROUP BY`, `CTEs`, `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`, and `RANKING`
- A fully structured PDF report with all the queries and logic

## 📌 Key Analysis

- Total layoffs by company, location, country, and industry
- Companies that shut down completely (100% laid off)
- Yearly and monthly layoff trends
- Top companies by layoffs each year using window functions
- Rolling total layoffs over time

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me practice:

- Analytical thinking with raw data
- Writing scalable and modular SQL queries
- Using CTEs and window functions effectively
- Understanding business impacts through data

🚀 *"Data is not just numbers, it's the story of what happened."*
